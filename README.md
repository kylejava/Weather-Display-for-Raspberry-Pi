Hello! My name is Kyle Java
I am creating a program that would allow the user input their city and show the current weather and time
on a Raspberry Pi display

!!!Still trying to figure out how to get the time for EACH city,
    as of right now itll only print the time on your local computer
    it will still print the weather of the city you enter


Materials:
1. Raspberry pi
2. LCD screen (at least 16x2)
3. Female to Female wires
* IF you dont have female to female wires you can use a breadboard, but you need 8 female to male wires
4. breadboard(optional)
5. Button


Program Runs:
1. Computer will ask for users city
2. City's weather and time will prompt  on the lcd display
3. User can enter another city name and will be added to a list
4. User can change city on the display by holding down button until city changes
