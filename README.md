Hello! My name is Kyle Java
I am creating a program that would allow the user input their city and show the current weather and time
on a Raspberry Pi display

Materials:
1. Raspberry pi
2. LCD screen (at least 16x2)
3. Female to Female wires
* IF you dont have female to female wires you can use a breadboard, but you need 8 female to male wires
4. breadboard
5. Resistor
6. Button

Program Runs:
1. Computer will ask for users city
2. City's weather and time will prompt  on the lcd display
3. User can enter another city name and will be added to a list
4. User can change city location by pressing the button on breadboard
